# compile-execute-cpp

#### Compile and execute a `.cpp` file with minimal typing

This script lets you compile and run a C++ file with minimal typing. Works on \*nix systems.

## How to Use

### Requirements
* wget
* Bash along with an existing `.bashrc` file

### Get It
Open a terminal and run `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghosh-r/compile-execute-cpp/main/ce_setup.sh`. This will download a file `ce_setup.sh` in your current directory.

### Set-up
* Run `chmod +x ce_setup.sh` to give it permission to execute.
* Run `sudo ./ce_setup.sh` to complete the setup. Provide password when asked.

*Note: You must run the setup with root privilege for repeated use of the script.*

### Using
After you have completed writing your `.cpp` file, open a terminal in that directory and run `ce file.cpp` to compile and execute with a single command.

`ce` stands for 'compile execute'.
